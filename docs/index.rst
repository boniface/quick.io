QuickIO's documentation
=======================

QuickIO's documentation consists of numerous sections. If you're looking for general information on how the server works, proceed to the :doc:`overview/index`. If you're just trying to get a better feel for how to use a QuickIO client, jump straight to :doc:`overview/client_usage`. If you're looking to work on the server itself and need an understanding of its internals, check out :doc:`hacking/index`. If you want documentation on any of the server binaries and helpers, either read their man pages, or browse the :doc:`binaries/index` page.
